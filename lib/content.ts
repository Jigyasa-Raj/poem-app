        content: `I want to collect all my metaphors like a postmaster collecting letters and deliver it at your doorsteps, but you see, I am out of paper and my little bicycle is rusted. So I am sending you some addresses, devoid of any aggression, yet to be addressed, so please keep them safe for further references. 

(I)

I want to sing a song that sounds like my grandmother
But my poetry doesn't speak of beauty 
And I dare not write her into something that is not beautiful 

(II) 

I don't count things anymore 
The last time I tried counting
the good things I had done,
the world pulled me back.

The last time I tried counting
the number of parathas 
I brought to the dining table 
without stuffing it with extra thoughts,
the world filled my chutney with insecurities. 

I have trouble crossing the road
but anger doesnâ€™t look both ways
before crossing mine.

The last time I tried counting
the number of people that left,
it turned out to be a Fibonacci series.
The last time I tried counting
the number of happy poems I've written,
it turned out in negatives

and I wanted to pull my guts 
and throw them out of my body.

(III)

My mother will hate me if she gets to know I make her daughter sleep on floors.
My mother will hate me if she gets to know that dogs on streets are not the only ones howling on cold nights.
My mother will hate me if she knows I swallow all the prayers her daughter tries sending.
My mother will hate me if she ever reads this poem.
My mother will hate me.

(IV)

I was born like this.
I remember too much.
I never have an appetite; I feed on the head of flowers that grow in my own field, I feed on my own body, which is to say I never bite my fingernails but I eat off my toes.
I have counted deaths more times than I have tried living my life.

I carry three faces and sometimes all of them refuse to match my reflections.

(V)

There's a home I'm trying to build for myself. There are trigger warnings written under my nameplate at the entrance, I'm trying to change that. In some corner, I have a museum built for her daughter; it has all her lost possessions, each of them placed carefully. There's enough room for all the reflections I chose to abandon. There's a doormat too, it welcomes you with a smile. 

There's a home I'm trying to build for myself, it's a warm place as safe and strong as my mother's womb.`

How was your morning today, did you forget to put up alarms or were your panic attacks so uncalled for that it shushed them before you could.

Did you forget to water your plants today or were you so lost that you watered them extra enough for them to die, when will you start treating your plants right, when will you start treating yourself right, when.

How long has it been since you got stuck in that one trippy note that you no longer remember the lyrics to the songs you named yours.

Did you burn your food again or did bring your parathas, to your dining table, stuffed with extra thoughts and placed it beside the plate of chutney spiced with insecurities.

Did you pay your electricity bills, your maintenance bills, how long have you kept them pending, do you know the consequences, are you ready to pay the fine to your body which youâ€™ve intentionally deprived of these services.

Did your anxiety stop you from crossing your road again or were you drowned enough in your own mind for your ears to be numb to the honking and eyes blind to the big bold â€˜stopâ€™ signs.

Do you write yourself honey laden love letters every time you hide behind self-depreciating humor.

Did your fingernails turn blue today because of the cold or were you so blue that you turned cold,maybe itâ€™s the blue you donâ€™t have an answer to or itâ€™s the cold youâ€™ve been trying to escape.

How long has it been winter for you.
Do you promise yourself sunrises every time you watch a sunset.

There's water droplets dripping down the clothes she's hanging and i don't know if mine will ever call rain. my ears can hear the dripping and my cracked lips yearn for it, but you see my senses aren't collaborating and i do not know how to end this paralysis. i have swallowed an entire burning city and my eyes like to mistake fuel for extinguishers every time i order a cyclone. . i'm standing barefoot on the ground in the middle of that city, with my tongue wrapped around my neck, will you still hear me if i keep screaming and none of it comes out to be poetry?`

i could remember

tonight
the failing shade of my shadows
outshined the shine on the lookout

subtly fatal
built on terrible lies
lays the lines of lifelong longing

would you still trade
your sanity for my love and maybe
condemn your wisdom for my insanity

would you still reconcile
my cravings carved under the
shade of every line i remember`

        content: `My mother hates my poetry
she wants her daughter to
be strong and my poems
come from the pen of a
soul she thinks is too fragile.
The other day she asked me
to tear them apart,shatter the words
I tried to pull myself together in.
Yesterday night was too dark and
I couldnâ€™t find a ground to lay in,
so I buried myself in them.

She hates them and I donâ€™t tell her
that, i hate them too, even more.
On some days Iâ€™m an atheist
standing barefoot on the sacred steps
of a temple,ringing its bell loud.
Too loud, it can cause religious riots.
Other days Iâ€™m a monk begging
for food outside the same temples
enchanting/mumbling prayers that
fade into nothingness, but you see, not all
sympathies are entitled to empathy
and so I don't burn my poems but
also don't save them
from turning into ashes.

I carry buckets of empathy for others
to pour themselves in, even the
the ones that I canâ€™t afford, the
ones too heavy to carry, Iâ€™ve wailed
on rains collected from the wells
that weren't named after me and
have mourned the death of unknowns.
And my mother, she, hates this.

She wants her daughter to be happy
and her daughter wants that too
so when her daughter writes on days
her mother sings, she leaves
few of her poems incomplete in the
hopes that theyâ€™ll find a happier ending
unlike the fatal metaphors
they were born out of
unlike the dying home
they have left behind

unlike the ones
in her motherâ€™s drawers
because her mother wrote too.`

My poetry is the dead body
i couldn't gain the courage to cremate
so i laid it to rest under my ink
My poetry is my shelter
It is my home
and my home is pretty messed up,
it does not have arranged cupboards
my home has water dripping down the ceilings,
my home has clogged drains,
the walls have cracks
and the paint is coming off
the maintenance bills are long due
you are welcomed here, i have warm tea
come stay, make yourself comfortable
but do not ask me to change the furniture

My poems are not beautiful
Before you call my poem beautiful
call it a diaster, call it a tragedy
It's fucked up
It's a mother's tear
and a father's fear
It's a child learning to walk
It's innocent, it's broken
My poetry is angry
It's ravaged
It's that sharp object
you are asked to touch carefully
It comes in 'handle with care' packages

My poetry is not a piece of art
It does not come to your talent show
my poetry is my therapy,
my survival and survival is no competition
My poetry is baptized with my rotten blood
there are ghosts running everywhere
It knows they died a long, long time ago
My poetry also knows counting,
it has counted the number of times
it had to caresses my forehead
to put me to sleep
My poetry cries at sunrises
they come in war with me everytime i turn
something that hurts into meaningful metaphors

My poetry comes with trigger warnings
It's my suicide notes
turned into love letters
My poetry is laden with my saliva
that glitters in gold
So please, please
let my poems breathe
and let it give someone a breath

And if you try to judge it,
please,
please shut the fuck up.`

(i) the ocean you swallow within you every night in one sip
(ii) your parents going back and forth from work to give you the best they can
(iii) kids who sell balloons on streets
(iv) barren homes with chipped paint and memories hanging down ceilings
(v) forgotten souls buried in unknown cemeteries who could not live the stories they painted for themselves

(vii) the poems you write
(viii) the seas you are drowning in
(ix) you on your eighteenth birthday
(x) you, the way you know you`
